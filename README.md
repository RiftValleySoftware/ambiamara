INTRODUCTION
=
This is a basic countdown timer app. It was designed specifically for public speakers.

This app is [publicly available on the Apple App Store](). It is an [Apple iOS-only](https://www.apple.com/ios) app, written in [Swift](https://www.apple.com/swift/).

This app requires iOS devices (iPhones, iPads and iPods), running iOS 10 or greater.

This is a proprietary-code application, and the code is not licensed for reuse.

The app features a nascent (unused) Apple Watch app. It was determined that the communication between phone and Watch was too unreliable to qualify the companion app for release, but the app has been left in the codebase for possible future deployment.

THIRD-PARTY CODE

This uses elements of [the excellent SwipeableTabBarController, by Marcos Griselli](https://github.com/marcosgriselli/SwipeableTabBarController) to handle an animated tab transition.
