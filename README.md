ABOUT AMBIAMARA
=
This is a rich countdown timer app. It was designed specifically for public speakers.

This app is [publicly available on the Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ambiamara/id1448933389). It is an [Apple iOS-only](https://www.apple.com/ios) app, written in [Swift](https://www.apple.com/swift/).

[This is the basic instruction page for AmbiaMara](https://riftvalleysoftware.com/work/ios-apps/ambiamara/)

This app requires iOS devices (iPhones, iPads and iPods), running iOS 10 or greater.

This is a proprietary-code application, and the code is not licensed for reuse. The code is provided as open-source, for purposes of auditing and demonstration of [The Great Rift valley Software Company](https://riftvalleysoftware.com) coding style.


HISTORY
-
This project was initially released in October, 2012, as "SpeakerBeeper," and written in Objective-C.

In May, 2017, it was rewritten in Swift, and released as "An Excellent Countdown Timer."

In April, 2019, it was again rewritten, and released as "AmbiaMara."

NO WATCH APP
-
The app features a nascent (unused) Apple Watch app. It was determined that the communication between phone and Watch was too unreliable to qualify the companion app for release, but the app has been left in the codebase for possible future deployment.

We are hoping this changes.

THIRD-PARTY CODE
=
This uses elements of [the excellent SwipeableTabBarController, by Marcos Griselli](https://github.com/marcosgriselli/SwipeableTabBarController) to handle an animated swipeable tab transition, like Android gives you.

LOCALIZATION
=
Localization was commissioned from the folks at [Babble-on](https://www.ibabbleon.com).
