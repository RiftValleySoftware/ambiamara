INTRODUCTION
=
This is a basic countdown timer app. It was designed specifically for public speakers.

This app is [publicly available on the Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/x-timer/id1244827875?mt=8). It is an [Apple iOS-only](https://www.apple.com/ios) app, written in [Swift](https://www.apple.com/swift/).

This app requires iOS devices (iPhones, iPads and iPods), running iOS 10 or greater.

[The source code repository for the app is on GitHub.](https://github.com/LittleGreenViper/x-timer)

This is a proprietary-code application, and the code is not licensed for reuse. It is open as sample code, or to give examples that may assist others in solving issues in their own programming.

The app features a nascent (unused) Apple Watch app. It was determined that the communication between phone and Watch was too unreliable to qualify the companion app for release, but the app has been left in the codebase for possible future deployment.

**NOTE:** The code is highly structured, but documentation is more sparse than open-source code, as only one person (the author) needs to review it, so we use descriptive method and property names.

THIRD-PARTY CODE

This uses elements of [the excellent SwipeableTabBarController, by Marcos Griselli](https://github.com/marcosgriselli/SwipeableTabBarController) to handle an animated tab transition.
