Create as many timers as you like and organize them into groups, where they run sequentially. You can drag and drop timers between groups.

Each timer has two optional thresholds: a warning (yellow) and a final (red), indicating you’re nearing the end.

You can set short transition sounds between timers in a group, and a final ending alarm when all timers in a group finish.

There are three large, easy-to-read displays:
    • NUMERIC: A classic digital-style countdown.
    • CIRCULAR: A donut-shaped timer that empties as time passes.
    • STOPLIGHTS: Green, yellow, and red lights that change as thresholds are reached—ideal for debates.";
